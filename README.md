# random-password-generator

## As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets a certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

I was able to build and render the prompts, how many characters do you want your password to be, do you want lower caseletters, uppercase letters, numeric, and/or special characters. However they are now not showing on my deployed site, and the password doesn't generate either so I've definitely made some mistakes along the way. 

I've scheduling a tutoring session to go over this and see where I went wrong.
