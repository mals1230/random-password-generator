# random-password-generator

## As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets a certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

I was able to build and render the prompts, how many characters do you want your password to be, do you want lower caseletters, uppercase letters, numeric, and/or special characters. However I encountered many errors along the way and I still have an error not allowing the code to loop back to start if a user doesn't choose any of the character options. And my final password is not rending either. 

I'm scheduling a tutoring session to go over this and see where I went wrong.
